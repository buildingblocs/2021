# Coursemology

This year, all participants are invited to BuildingBloCS 2021 Course on our Coursemology page! The Coursemology Initiative aims to provide participants with a platform to regularly practice their programming and computational thinking skills.

In the course, participants will have access to questions specially crafted by the workshop speakers to aid students in better understanding the workshop content. They will also have access to questions and tasks focusing on the O-level Computing Syllabus and Project Euler. New tasks and questions will be released periodically.
