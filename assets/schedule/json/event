The event aims to bring students from different schools and backgrounds together for a week of fun and exciting activities. These activities include workshops, tournaments, challenges, etc. </p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Workshop Series</u></strong></p><p>Similar to previous years, BuildingBloCS will be conducting a variety of workshops under our Workshop Series Initiative. The Workshop Series Initiative aims to expose students to the different aspects of computing ranging from game development to cybersecurity. This would be done through introductory-level workshops with gentle learning curves, hopefully sparking an interest in the participants to explore more into that field. <br></p><p>This year, BuildingBloCS would be conducting a total of 12 workshops! The workshops would run from 29th May to 31st May with the workshops being grouped into 3 different tracks (one track per day):</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://eventyay.com/e/add36405/schedule?sort=starts-at&amp;track=Programming%20Languages%20101%3A\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Languages 101</a> — 29th May</li><li><a href=\"https://eventyay.com/e/add36405/schedule?sort=starts-at&amp;track=The%20World%20of%20Application%20Development%3A\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Making Games (&amp; playing them)</a> — 30th May</li><li><a href=\"https://eventyay.com/e/add36405/schedule?track=Making%20Games%20(%26%20Playing%20Them)%3A\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The World of Application Development</a> — 31st May</li></ul><p><em>Note: The tickets for the various workshops are structured according to the tracks. For eg, if you wish to participate in the “Playing with Minecraft Plugins” workshop, you would have to sign up for the “Making Games (&amp; playing them)” ticket. Once you have signed up for the ticket, you would have free access to all the workshops on that track. Attendance for all workshops in the same track is not compulsory. </em></p><p><br><em></em></p><p><strong><u>CodeCombat Tournament</u></strong></p><p>Apart from the workshops, BuildingBloCS would be hosting the inaugural National CodeCombat Tournament on 1st June! For the tournament, participants would form teams to battle it out against one another using their own wits and skills in the CodeCombat Arenas. Winners of the tournament will be nominated to participate in the Global and APAC Regional CodeCombat Tournaments in late August. </p><p>So sign up quickly to get access to CodeCombat licenses, resources and workshops which would help you greatly in preparing for the tournament! <br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Coursemology</u></strong></p><p>On top of that, this year, all participants would be invited to BuildingBloCS 2021 Course on our <a href=\"https://buildingblocs.coursemology.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coursemology</a> page! The Coursemology Initiative aims to provide participants with a platform to regularly practice their programming and computational thinking skills.  </p><p>In the course, participants would have access to questions specially crafted by the workshop speakers to aid students in better understanding the workshop content. They will also have access to questions and tasks focusing on the <a href=\"https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2021syllabus/7155_y21_sy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">O-level Computing Syllabus</a> and <a href=\"https://projecteuler.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Project Euler</a>. New tasks and questions would be released periodically. </p><p><br></p><p></p><p><strong>June Conference</strong></p><p>Last but not least, BuildingBloCS’s annual flagship conference would be happening from 2nd to 4th June. The conference is held in tandem with <a href=\"https://cte-stem2021.nie.edu.sg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CTE-STEM 2021 Conference</a>. Hence, the theme for the conference is “Computational Thinking &amp; AI Education”. <br></p><p>On the first two days of the conference, participants would be engaged in a series of activities ranging from keynote speeches by ex-computing students and industry professionals from Google, AI Singapore, etc. to workshops focusing on applications of AI. On the third day of the conference, BuildingBloCS would be organising a AI Winpetition where students would form their own teams and will be given various themes to choose from. The teams would then need to maximise their creative thinking and computational skills to come up with an innovative application of AI relating to the theme. Finally, various teams will be awarded titles, theme prizes and even some special awards!</p><br><br><p></p><p>If you want to book multiple tickets (eg. for group signups), please make a copy of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/bbcs21-bulksignup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this Google Sheet</a>, fill it in, and send an email the document to <a>hello@buildingblocs.sg</a> </p>","live-stream-url":null,"starts-at":"2021-05-21T16:00:00+08:00","identifier":"add36405","payment-country":null,"code-of-conduct":"BuildlingBloCS is a yearlong outreach programme for students, by students!
