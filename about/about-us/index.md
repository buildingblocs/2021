# About Us

### What is BuildingBloCS?

> &lsquo;A&rsquo; level / Integrated Programme and &lsquo;O&rsquo; level Computing students come together to build an infocomm-empowered future for a Better World!

BuildlingBloCS is a year-long outreach programme for students, by students! Activities and workshops will be conducted by JC Computing students, guided by their teachers, to educate people around the nation about the wonders of Computing, and spread its love. Activities need not be entirely technical, and they can be something like creatively integrating Computing concepts into usual activities!

### What is CTE-STEM?

CTE-STEM 2021 is a forum for worldwide sharing of ideas as well as dissemination of findings and outcomes on the implementation of Computational Thinking and STEM development from STEM educators and researchers globally. It will be an excellent opportunity to hear and discuss innovations, ideas, and practices during the conference.

### Changes this year

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this years BuildingBloCS will comprise a mixture of online and in-person workshops and activities.

### We have a Discord server!
