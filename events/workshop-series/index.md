# 2021 Workshop Series

Similar to previous years, BuildingBloCS will be conducting a variety of workshops under our Workshop Series Initiative. The Workshop Series Initiative aims to expose students to the different aspects of computing ranging from game development to cybersecurity. This will be done through introductory-level workshops with gentle learning curves, which will hopefully spark participants' interests in exploring more into the field of computing.

This year, BuildingBloCS will be conducting a total of 12 workshops! The workshops will run from **29th May to 31st May** with the workshops being grouped into 3 different tracks (one track per day):

- Programming Languages 101 — 29th May
- Making Games (& playing them) — 30th May
- The World of Application Development — 31st May

> <small>_Note: The tickets for the various workshops are structured according to the tracks. For example, if you wish to participate in the “Playing with Minecraft Plugins” workshop, you have to sign up for the “Making Games (& playing them)” ticket. Once you have signed up for the ticket, you will have free access to all the workshops on that track. Attendance for all workshops in the same track is not compulsory._</small>

### FOSSASIA 2021 Workshops

We have had our 7 introductory workshops at FOSSASIA Summit 2021! Check them out below!

<div>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Python</strong></summary>
<br>
Python is a widely used, high level programming language, but it is easy to get started on. <br><br> In this workshop, you will be learning about the fundamental skills of Python, such as syntax, lists and functions.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nothing much other than a desire to learn!
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Web Development with Flask</strong></summary>
<br>
With the help of Flask, a Python library, participants will be able to learn the basics of Web Development in building basic web-scraping applications. They will be free to explore and discover unique and interesting findings. Participants will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Python (Flask) in this session and leave with their flask website hosted on CodeCollab.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Python Basics
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Git/Github</strong></summary>
<br>
Open source development is increasingly prevalent in software development, powering many devices that we use daily. Originally developed for managing the Linux operating system, Git is an extremely powerful tool for managing computing projects.<br><br>Participants will learn what Git is and how it is different from GitHub, what programmers can use Git for, learn to perform basic operations (commit, pull etc) using a Git GUI Client, perform simple collaborative operations (merge, forking) and understand the use of pull requests in working on public open source projects.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Socket Programming with Python</strong></summary>
<br>
Socket programming and the socket API are used to send and receive information between two physical devices, known as nodes, within a network. Upon completing this workshop, participants will be able to understand and use the main functions and methods in Python’s socket module to build their own client-server applications such as a multiplayer game.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> A little experience with Python programming and a basic idea of Internet Protocols (IP).
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Data Science</strong></summary>
<br>
Data science is all about using data to solve problems. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of machine learning from loading data sets to creating predictive model, with the help of Scikit-learn (sklearn) to analyse data sets. At the end of the workshop, participants should be able to train a simple classifier and understand the data science lifecycle.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Python Basics
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to SQLite with Python</strong></summary>
<br>
SQLite is the most used database engine in the world, integrated into applications that people use everyday. Participants can anticipate learning the basics of using SQLite3 with Python such as how to create a database, insert, update and delete data, fetch queries and import data from given csv files. This would be done by creating a text menu for users to retrieve and update information.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Python Basics
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to MongoDB with Python</strong></summary>
<br>
MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. By the end of the workshop, participants would be able to build a Flask API with MongoDB to query and post data onto a server.
