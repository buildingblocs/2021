# June Conference

### Details

BuildingBloCSâ€™s annual flagship conference will be happening from **2nd to 4th June**. The conference is held in tandem with CTE-STEM 2021 Conference. Hence, the theme for the conference is "**Computational Thinking & AI Education**".

On the first two days of the conference, participants will be engaged in a series of activities ranging from keynote speeches by ex-computing students and industry professionals from Google, AI Singapore, etc. to workshops focusing on applications of AI. On the third day of the conference, BuildingBloCS is organising a AI Winpetition where students will form their own teams and be given various themes to choose from. The teams would then need to maximise their creative thinking and computational skills to come up with an innovative application of AI relating to the theme. Finally, various teams will be awarded titles, theme prizes and even some special awards!
