We have had our 7 introductory workshops at FOSSASIA Summit 2021! Check them out below!

<div>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Python</strong></summary>
<br>
Python is a widely used, high level programming language, which means that it is easy to get started on. <br><br> In this workshop, you will be learning about the fundamental skills of python, such as syntax, lists and functions.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nothing much other than a desire to learn!
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Web Development with Flask</strong></summary>
<br>
With the help of Flask, a Python library, participants will be able to learn the basics of Web Development in building basic web-scraping applications. They will be free to explore and discover unique and interesting findings. Participants will learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Python (Flask) in this session and leave with their flask website hosted on CodeCollab.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Python Basics
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Git/Github</strong></summary>
<br>
Open source development is increasingly prevalent in software development, powering many devices that we use daily. Originally developed for managing the Linux Operating System, Git is an extremely powerful tool for managing computing projects.<br><br>Participants will learn what Git is and how it is different from GitHub, what programmers can use Git for, learn to perform basic operations (commit, pull etc) using a Git GUI Client, perform simple collaborative operations (merge, forking) and understand the use of pull requests in working on public open source projects.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Socket Programming with Python</strong></summary>
<br>
Socket programming and the socket API are used to send and receive information between two physical devices, known as nodes, within a network. Upon completing this workshop, participants will be able to understand and use the main functions and methods in Python’s socket module to build their own client-server applications such as a multiplayer game.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> A little experience with python programming and a basic idea of Internet Protocols (IP).
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to Data Science</strong></summary>
<br>
Data science is all about using data to solve problems. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of machine learning from loading the data set to creating predictive models, with the help of sklearn to analyse the data sets. At the end of the workshop, participants should be able to train a simple classifier and understand the data science lifecycle.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Python Basics
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to SQLite with Python</strong></summary>
<br>
SQLite is the most used database engine in the world, integrated into applications that people use everyday. Participants can anticipate learning the basics of using SQLite3 with Python such as how to create a database, insert, update and delete data, fetch queries and import data from given csv files. This would be done by creating a text menu for users to retrieve and update information.
<br><br>
  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Python Basics
</details>
<br><br>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Introduction to MongoDB with Python</strong></summary>
<br>
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. By the end of the workshop, participants would be building a Flask API with MongoDB to query and post data onto a server somewhere.
