# AIWinpetition

## Details

The AIWinpetition is an innovation competition conducted by BuildingBloCS.SG in collaboration with AISG. Throughout the competition, students will be able to team up and work on an idea which brings their skills from previous workshops together.

Students will be given various themes to choose from and maximise their creative thinking and computational skills. Finally, various teams will be awarded titles and provided feedback on their ideas, including theme prizes and even some special awards!
